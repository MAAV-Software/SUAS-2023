# Setup Simulation Camera in Gazebo

By the end of this tutorial, you should have a simluated realsense camera in the gazebo simulation that publishes image data, depth data, and point-cloud data. This is currently a work in progress so don't get salty and ask Drew is you have questions. 

## Modify the quadcopter sdf file

Please make sure that a .sdf has been generated for the drone that you are simulating. By default the drone that Gazebo is simulating is called the `iris drone`. You can search the whole system for sdf files (robot description xml similar to `urdf`) using the following command. See [here](https://newscrewdriver.com/2018/07/31/ros-notes-urdf-vs-gazebo-sdf/#:~:text=My%20understanding%20can%20be%20boiled,can%20be%20represented%20in%20URDF.) for a description of the differences between sdf and urdf.

```
$ find / -name "*.sdf"          # all sdf files
$ find / -name "iris.sdf"       # for iris drone specifically
```
The iris file should be in /px4_sitl/PX4-Autopilot/Tools/sitl_gazebo/models/iris/iris.sdf

Edit the .sdf file using the code editor of your choice (e.g. vim, nano, etc).

```
$ vim /px4_sitl/PX4-Autopilot/Tools/sitl_gazebo/models/iris/iris.sdf
```

We are going to add our own plugin to the robot model! At the bottom of the file, add the following code between the last `</plugin>` tag and the `</model>` tag.

<ins>New Plugin XML:</ins>
```
  <!--depth camera -->
  <include>
    <uri>model://depth_camera</uri>
    <pose>0.15 0 0.00 0 0 0</pose>
  </include>
  <joint name="depth_camera_joint" type="fixed">
    <child>depth_camera::link</child>
    <parent>iris::base_link</parent>
    <axis>
      <xyz>0 0 1</xyz>
      <limit>
        <upper>0</upper>
        <lower>0</lower>
      </limit>
    </axis>
  </joint>
```

Finally, you want to update the width and height of the output image of this simulation camera (currently it's mad small...). To do this, edit the camera sdf in the file /px4_sitl/PX4-Autopilot/Tools/sitl_gazebo/models/depth_camera/depth_camera.sdf

```
$ vim /px4_sitl/PX4-Autopilot/Tools/sitl_gazebo/models/depth_camera/depth_camera.sdf
```

In this file, modify the `width` and `height` parameters to be 640 and 480 respectively.

Once you add to and save the file you can run the simulator again and look at the new camera model that was added to the front of the drone:
```
$ cd /px4_sitl/PX4-Autopilot
$ make px4_sitl gazebo
```


## Visualize the camera output and link with mavros

In order to view the output of the camera, we have to start the simulation in a lightly differnt way. Close out of all your current terminals follow the steps below.

**NOTE:** make sure that you are root by running:
```
$ sudo -i
```

### **Terminal 1:**
First, we will start the simulation with ROS wrappers by running the following. 

```
$ cd /px4_sitl/PX4-Autopilot
$ DONT_RUN=1 make px4_sitl_default gazebo
$ source /mission9-2022/software_ws/devel/setup.bash
$ source Tools/setup_gazebo.bash $(pwd) $(pwd)/build/px4_sitl_default
$ export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:$(pwd)
$ export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:$(pwd)/Tools/sitl_gazebo
$ roslaunch px4 posix_sitl.launch
```

I have also included a script named [gazebo_ros_wrap.sh](../scripts/install_everything.sh) in `/mission9-2022/scripts`

### **Terminal 2:**
run the rvis node in a new terminal:
```
$ . /mission9-2022/software_ws/devel/setup.bash
$ rosrun rviz rviz
```

### **Terminal 3:**
Now make sure that you justify the camera frame with the following command
If you have an error, this command will likely fix it.
**NOTE** This is likely not actually correct but it's okay for the time being.
```
$ rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 map [my_frame] 100
```



Happy Coding!
