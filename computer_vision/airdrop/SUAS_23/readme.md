# Python Computer Vision Folder for Image Detection

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+: Just install using the official way
- pipenv:
  - [Official Instructions](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/)
  - Quick Install:
    - Universal: `pip install --user pipenv`
    - Mac (using brew if you want): `brew install pipenv`

## Usage

1. **Important**: Go to the correct directory: `cd computer_vision/airdrop/SUAS_23`
2. Install the environment(only the first time): `pipenv install && pipenv install --dev`
3. Launch the environment: `pipenv shell`
4. Use Python normally: `python <name of your script>`

After the first install, you just need to run steps 3 and 4 for running anything in the future

If you want to install any additional packages, run: `pipenv install <package name>` just like you would for pip. For example, `pip install opencv-python` is now `pipenv install opencv-python`
